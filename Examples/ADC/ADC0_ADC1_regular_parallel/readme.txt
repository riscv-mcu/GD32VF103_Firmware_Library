  This demo is based on the GD32VF103V-EVAL-1.0 board, it shows how to use ADC0 and ADC1
regular_parallel convert function. PA3 and PA0 are configured in AIN mode. TIMER1_CH1 
is the trigger source of ADC0. ADC1 external trigger chooses none. When the rising edge
of TIMER1_CH1 coming, ADC0 and ADC1 regular channels are triggered at the same time. The
values of ADC0 and ADC1 are transmit to array adc_value[] by DMA.
  
  We can watch array adc_value[] in debug mode.
