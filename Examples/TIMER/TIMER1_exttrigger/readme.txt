  This demo is based on the GD32VF103V-EVAL-V1.0 board, it shows how to start TIMER 
peripherals with an external trigger.

  TIMER1 is configured as slave timer for an external trigger connected to TIMER1 
CI0 pin:
  - The TIMER1 CI0FE0 is used as trigger input.
  - Rising edge is used to start the TIMER1: event mode.
  - TIMER1 CH2(PA2) is used PWM Mode 0. 
  The starts of the TIMER1 counter are controlled by the external trigger. 

  Connect the TIMER1 CH0(PA0) pin to +3V3 on the board as a external trigger with a
rising edge.
