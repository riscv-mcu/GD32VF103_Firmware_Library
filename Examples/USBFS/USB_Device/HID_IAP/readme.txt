  This demo is based on the GD32VF103V-EVAL-V1.0 board,it provides a description of 
how to use the USBFS peripheral.

  The GD32 device is enumerated as an USB Custom HID device for IAP, that uses the 
native PC Host HID driver.

  To test the demo, you need a configuration hex image or bin image. The hex image
or the bin image should set application address at 0x8010000. 

  To test the demo, you need to:
    - Download the "USB IAP Client" PC applet
    - Start the "USB IAP Client" PC applet and connect GD32 USB to PC (Note: maybe
      the driver installion is failed in the first time, try reseating again.)
    - The device should be detected and shown in the PC applet
    - Select the hex image and download it to the flash
    - After each device reset, the mcu will enter IAP mode
    - After each device reset, hold down the key A on the GD32VF103V-EVAL board 
      to run the new application
